# MLe-KCNQ2: An Artificial Intelligence Model for the Prognosis of Missense KCNQ2 Gene Variants

This repository contains the code implementation referenced in our published paper focusing on the development of a machine learning model for predicting pathogenicity in variants of the KCNQ2 gene. The model presented in the paper offers insights into the potential pathogenicity of various genetic variants within the KCNQ2 gene, aiding in clinical decision-making and genetic counseling.
